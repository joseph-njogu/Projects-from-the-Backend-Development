# Projects-from-the-Backend-Development
This repo contains different projects illustrating the work done underlying the #26 topics of backend Development basics.
This includes django projects that will require you to install your own virtual environments. It also includes testing, pytest, unittest, mocking, coverge alongside tox. For more of this it would be better if you take a step and run them by yourself, actions are better. Hands on working that is.
